## 1.0.9b

## 1.0.9

* Oh well. Print layout was not really properly fixed, so it was kind of built from the ground up again. There MIGHT be some quirks left, but after testing it with 3 different feature-length scripts, it seems to work fine and return about the same page length as other screenwriting apps (within +-1-2 page range). I'm very sorry for any inconvenience. Mostly for myself.
* Print preview now jumps to the selected scene.
* Scenes can be reordered by dragging & dropping in card view. This is an experimental feature for now and not enabled in released version.
* Memory management issues with windows have been fixed.


## 1.0.8

* Major change: I'll start updating this changelog
* Beat now uses a customized RegexKitLite, as OSSpinLock is deprecated in macOS 10.12+
* PDF/printing layout is better now. It still uses the old FNHTMLScript and FNPaginate code, but they are customized. Longer action paragraphs will now break apart between pages. Dialogue blocks should also behave in a more consistent way.
* Omitted scenes no longer retain their scene number. They are still formatted correctly, though.
* New flat array structure for outline elements - just after I replaced it with the multi-level structure. The whole outline logic should be rewritten, but for now, I'll be using these parallel structures.

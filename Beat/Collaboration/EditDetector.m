@implementation EditDetector
/*

 Work in progress (very much)
 
 The idea is to get a automated collaboration workflow between two files at a cloud service. Meaning, no live editing, but the option to APPEND and WITHDRAW certain changes to the current document.
 
 As planned, the process would go as follows:
 - Get our current saved file contents (requires caching the string)
 - Get their saved file contents
 - Compare OUR saved and edited file, save changed indices
 - Compare THEIR saved and edited file to our SAVED file
 - Apply their changes to the saved file
 - Append our changes to the file
 
 There are many places where this could go wrong, but I'm planning to try it out, at least.

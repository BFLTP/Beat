## Fix FDX Import Bugs

* Double scene headings

## Parser

* There is a known bug which begins at parser level, because doesn't really understand nested styling. Stuff gets stylized correctly, but ranges are messed up. For example, ***Bold** italic* leaves the third asterisk into formatting ranges. Quick fix: `(\*\*)(?!\*)(.*)(\*\*)`  

# Work in progress

## Pagination

* Allow pagination to happen from a given index. This is a LOT harder than it sounds, because of everything.

## Document.m

* Sanitize and clean old stuff (please define what exactly)
* Fix the logic on how current scene is set and read from elsewhere, especially outline & timeline

## Index Cards

* Check and fix dark mode UI
* Full rewrite to Cocoa when possible

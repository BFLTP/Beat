# High-priority

## Fix FDX Import Bugs

* Double scene headings

## Sanitize delegates

Right now, there are many, many delegates which do almost the same thing. It would be pretty sensible to write a single delegate, which could be reused almost anywhere. That's pretty much what `BeatEditorDelegate` does, and most controls and classes could perhaps use it directly? 


# Work in progress

## Pagination

* Allow pagination to happen from a given index. This is a LOT harder than it sounds, because of everything.

## Document.m

* Sanitize and clean old stuff (please define what exactly)
* Fix the logic on how current scene is set and read from elsewhere, especially outline & timeline

## Index Cards

* Check and fix dark mode UI
* Full rewrite to Cocoa when possible

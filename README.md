# Beat

Beat is a bare-bones screenwriting app. It uses Fountain files, which is a plain-text screenplay format, readable by many other apps such as Slugline, Logline, Storyboarder and KIT Scenarist just to name a few.

Fountain screenplays are easy to write and require only some knowledge of the underlying syntax. Scene headers, dialogue, parentheses, characters etc. are recognized automatically.

Beat is an enhanced version of **Writer** by Hendrik Noeller (https://github.com/HendrikNoeller/Writer/releases/tag/2.1.1) and adds small features like automatic scene numbering and more readable layout.

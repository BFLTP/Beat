# Beat

A simple and elegant screenwriting app for macOS. It uses the plain-text Fountain screenplay format. It's fast, small and has a distraction free minimalistic UI.

Beat is originally a fork of **Writer** by Hendrik Noeller (https://github.com/HendrikNoeller/Writer/) and still leans on his work with the continuous Fountain parser.

This started as a personal project as I needed a simple, multi-window and lightweight screenwriting application for my own films. The ones that existed were expensive and/or cumbersome (looking at you, Final Draft), weird (most others) or lacked some pretty important features such as automatic scene numbering (like otherwise great Slugline and Logline).

Beat has it all, and **it's free and open source**.

I am an artist and a filmmaker, and my programming skills are somewhat limited, so I'm open for any suggestions, improvements, feedback and collaboration. I hope that Beat will work easier and more enjoyable for everyone.

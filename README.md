# Beat

A simple and elegant screenwriting app for macOS, using the plain-text Fountain screenplay format. It's pretty fast and lighteight and, above all, has a distraction free, minimalistic UI. Beat is also **free and open source** and will remain so.

Beat is originally a fork of **Writer** by Hendrik Noeller (https://github.com/HendrikNoeller/Writer/) and about a third of the code still originates from his work, especially within the magnificent continuous Fountain parser.

This started as a personal project as I needed a simple, multi-window and lightweight screenwriting application for my own films, preferrably using Fountain files. The ones that existed were weird, expensive and/or cumbersome or even lacked some pretty important features - such as automatic and visible scene numbering while writing. At this point Beat pretty much outdoes most of the commercial Fountain editors, with certain limitations, of course.

There is an iOS version on the way, scheduled for release in mid-2020. It won't be free (very cheap though), but a big chunk of its code is still under GPL. Parts of Beat are under MIT license.

I am an artist and a filmmaker, so my programming skills are somewhat limited. I'm open to any suggestions, improvements, feedback and collaboration.


## Latest release: Beat 1.1.0i

**Features**
* Minimalistic UI that stays out of the way
* Automatic screenplay formatting, no need for shortcuts or hotkeys
* Dark mode for the children of the night
* Full support for Fountain syntax
* Final Draft import/export
* PDF export
* Title page editor
* Automatic scene numbering in edit view â€“ with forced scene number recognition
* Outline list view, with sections and synopses, scene reordering and filtering
* Outline card view, with sections & synopses
* Timeline view with sections & synopses
* Autocomplete characters and scene headings
* Color-coded scenes
* Analysis view, with line count per character, amount lines by gender, scene locations, etc.
* Faster and more stable than before

**Note:** This repository follows my development, so it DOES NOT match the latest release version. Dread lightly, dear friend!

## Future

### State of development

Beat is under active development when I have the time -- or rather, desperately need a new feature myself. Worst bugs will usually be fixed ASAP.

As of 1.1.0, the app is finally pretty stable and has remained very minimalistic.

Some future considerations:

* Removing all stuff having to do with the ancient Fountain open source stuff, including references to RegexKitLite
* Show pages in edit view (probably not, though)
* Have Beat only allow happy endings (somewhat limiting)
* Making the world a better place (not enough coding skills)
* Planting some trees to fight climate change (WIP)

### How can you help?

Well, I'm not sure, but please do. As stated above, the person behind this project is not a real programmer. When I started the project, my understanding of Objective-C was little to none, and it shows. Though my code has been getting gradually better, there are still silly things going on. Any help and feedback is appreciated.

At times, to vent my frustration, I've included quotes from my favourite poets as comments in the code. They include Forough Farrokhzad, Marina Tsvetaeva and Charles Bukowski. All apologies.

Bug reports, some donations and feedback help, but I'd be happy if someone could help with zooming and rearranging the code.

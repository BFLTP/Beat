# Beat

Beat is a bare-bones screenwriting app using the plain-text Fountain screenplay format.

Beat is a fork of **Writer** by Hendrik Noeller (https://github.com/HendrikNoeller/Writer/releases/tag/2.1.1). Beat adds small features like automatic scene numbering, better outlining and a fancier layout.

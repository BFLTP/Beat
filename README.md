# Beat

A simple and elegant screenwriting app for macOS, using the plain-text Fountain screenplay format. It's pretty fast and lighteight and, above all, has a distraction free, minimalistic UI. Beat is also **free and open source**.

Beat is originally a fork of **Writer** by Hendrik Noeller (https://github.com/HendrikNoeller/Writer/) and still leans on his work, especially with the magnificent continuous Fountain parser.

This started as a personal project as I needed a simple, multi-window and lightweight screenwriting application for my own films, preferrably using Fountain files. The ones that existed were expensive and/or cumbersome , weird or lacked some pretty important features  - such as automatic scene numbering.

I am an artist and a filmmaker, and my programming skills are somewhat limited, so I'm open to any suggestions, improvements, feedback and collaboration. I hope that Beat will make work easier and more enjoyable for everyone!

## Latest release: Beat 1.0.6

* Autocomplete characters and scene headings
* Automatic scene numbering in edit view â€“- this has some quirks, but works. Recognizes Fountain scene numbering.
* Set colors for scene headings, synopses and sections by typing `[[COLOR RED]]` (or any other common color) after the heading. This is an experimental feature for now.
* Small visual bug fixes

**Note:** This repository follows my development and does NOT match the released versions. Dread lightly, dear friend!

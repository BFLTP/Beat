# Beat

A simple and elegant screenwriting app for macOS. It uses the plain-text Fountain screenplay format. It's fast, small and has a distraction free minimalistic UI.

Beat is originally a fork of **Writer** by Hendrik Noeller (https://github.com/HendrikNoeller/Writer/) and still leans on his work, especially with the magnificent continuous Fountain parser.

This started as a personal project as I needed a simple, multi-window and lightweight screenwriting application for my own films, preferrably using Fountain files. The ones that existed were expensive and/or cumbersome , weird or lacked some pretty important features  - such as automatic scene numbering.

Beat has it all, and **it's free and open source**.

I am an artist and a filmmaker, and my programming skills are somewhat limited, so I'm open to any suggestions, improvements, feedback and collaboration. I hope that Beat will make work easier and more enjoyable for everyone!
